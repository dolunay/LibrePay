## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [LibrePay Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [LibrePay@github.com](mailto:LibrePay@github.com).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

We still don't have a Message Board, Facebook group or whatever. So, by now, just send an email to LibrePay@github.com.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a Bug Report for LibrePay. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating a Bug Report, please test the "nightly" development branch, as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a Bug Report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](issue_template.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** Regressions can happen. If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like your issue, go ahead and open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one. All you need to create a link is the issue number, preceded by #. For example, #8888.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Use the New Issue button to create an issue and provide the following information by filling in [the template](issue_template.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining how you started LibrePay, e.g. which icon you touched on your device, or how you started LibrePay otherwise. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or a LibrePay command, and if so which one?
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets or log output in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include detailed log output** as provided on the IDE.
* **Include screenshots, links to videos, etc.** which clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **Include the steps** (if relevant) that reliably causes the problem to show itself.
* **If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action**, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.

Provide more context:

* **Can you reproduce the problem with a minimum of steps?**
* **Did the problem start happening recently** (e.g. after updating to a new version of LibrePay) or was this always a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce the problem in an older version of LibrePay?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen? You can download older versions of LibrePay from [the releases page](https://github.com/LibrePayFirmware/LibrePay/releases).
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* **Which version of LibrePay are you using?** LibrePay's exact version and build date can be seen in the about page.
* **What kind of device and operational system are you using**?
* **What kind of add-ons (if relevant) do you have**?
* **Include your Configuration.** Make a screenshot of the configuration page, but please hide any personal information as API keys.

### Suggesting Features or Changes

This section guides you through submitting a suggestion for LibrePay, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating a suggestion, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](issue_template.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting a Feature Request

* **Check the [LibrePay website](http://LibrePay.not.yet.released/)** for tips â€” you might discover that the feature is already included. Most importantly, check if you're using [the latest version of LibrePay](https://github.com/johnnyasantoss/LibrePay/releases) and if you can get the desired behavior by changing [LibrePay's config settings](http://LibrePay.not.yet.released/docs/configuration/configuration.html).
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/johnnyasantoss/LibrePay/issues?q=is%3Aissue)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Feature Request?

Feature Requests are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Please follow these guidelines in your request:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the requested feature** in as much detail as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and links to videos** which demonstrate the feature or point out the part of LibrePay to which the request is related.
* **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most LibrePay users.
* **Name other applications that have this feature, if any.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to LibrePay? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][good-first-issue] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help Wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests should always be targeted to working branches (e.g., `issue-8888`) and never to release branches (e.g., `master`). If this is your first Pull Request, please read Github's [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) documentation.

* Fill in [the required template](pull_request_template.md).
* Don't include issue numbers in the PR title.
* Include pictures, diagrams, and links to videos in your Pull Request to demonstrate your changes, if needed.
* Follow the [Coding Standards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).
* Document new code with clear and concise comments.
* End all files with a newline.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
* Reference issues and Pull Requests liberally after the first line.

### C# Coding Standards

* Please read and follow the [Coding Standards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions). Failure to follow these guidelines will delay evaluation and acceptance of Pull Requests.

### Documentation

* Guidelines for documentation are still under development. In-general, be clear, concise, and to-the-point.

### Acknowledgment

* This gidelines were adapted from the ones at the wonderful @LibrePayFirmware. Thank you @thinkyhead and everyone working at LibrePay project.
